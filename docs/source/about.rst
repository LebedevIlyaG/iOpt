About us
========

The iOpt is developed and maintained by the team from Nizhny Novgorod State University. The founder and scientific leader of the team is prof. R.G. Strongin.

The results obtained by the supervising of prof. R.G. Strongin constitute a new direction in the field of models, methods and software tools for solving complex optimization problems (multi-extremal, multicriteria, with non-convex constraints, mixed-integer, etc.).
